# Python+PostgreSQL development virtual environment template

This template is a complete Visual Studio Code devcontainer for developing Python applications that use PostgreSQL.

In addition to Python and PostgreSQL, this template contains:

- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** for packaging and dependency management
- **[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)** for unified [linting](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black)-compatible [formatting](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/)
- An example project that uses [Litestar](https://litestar.dev/) and SQLAlchemy

The purpose of this template is more for the environment itself plus pre-configured Poetry, Ruff, etc. than the example application. The example demonstrates a simple (but functional) CRUD flow for API <-> SQLAlchemy <-> PostgreSQL. The project's file structure is inspired by domain-driven design and is overkill for the example.

If you would like to learn more about designing and structuring Litestar/FastAPI applications, I recommend giving [FastAPI Best Practices
](https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices) a read.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jawfish/python-template.git
    ```

2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    cd python-template
    code .
    ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The example environment variables are for the example project and will work out of the box.

4. Open the command palette and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`. This will build the devcontainer and open the project in a container.  This may take a few minutes the first time. `poetry install` will be run automatically when the container is built to install the project dependencies.


5. To run the example application, open a terminal in VSCode and run:

    ```bash
    poetry run app
    ```

    This will start the application on port 8000. VSCode's integrated devcontainer functionally should forward this port for host access. Head to http://localhost:8000/docs to see the API documentation for the example application.

## Configuration

Configuration for the devcontainer can be managed in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. This file is used by VSCode to build the devcontainer (in addition to `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`). Everything there should be relatively self-explanatory.
